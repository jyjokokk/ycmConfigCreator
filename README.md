# ycmConfigGenerator

A simple script for generating a [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe#python-semantic-completion)
configuration file that lets YCM know the correct interpreter path.

Only works if the virtual environment is active.

Will be later used as a part of a Python project folder creating script.
